 * The RequestHandler constructor initializes several properties on the

 * @param {Object} logger - the logger instance
 * @class RequestHandler
 * @classdesc The RequestHandler class provides a centralized way of managing a
 * pool of ongoing requests and routing there callback execution to the right
 * handlers. The RequestHandler relies on the diag-common request factory
 * and therefore only manages the routing of execution to the proper callback
 * and does not do any queueing/batching. The RequestHandler instance has
 * several properties: the projectId property is used to create a correct url
 * for interacting with the API and key property can be optionally provided a
 * value which can be used in place of default application authentication. The
 * shouldReportErrors property will dictate whether or not the handler instance
 * will attempt to send payloads to the API. If it is false the handler will
 * immediately call back to the completion callback with a constant error value.
 * @property {Function} _request - a npm.im/request style request function that
 *  provides the transport layer for requesting against the Error Reporting API.
 *  It includes retry and authorization logic.
 * @property {String} _projectId - the project id used to uniquely identify and
 *  address the correct project in the Error Reporting API
 * @property {Object} _logger - the instance-cached logger instance
